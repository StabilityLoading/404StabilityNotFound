**404: Stability Not Found** is a project for thinking about what comes next.  
After the collapse of the neoconservative and neoliberal orders, weâ€™re left with broken systems, fraying alliances, and rising uncertainty.  
This blog is a space to explore power, collapse, and possibility â€” slowly, seriously, and freely.

No easy answers. No empty nostalgia. Only the edge of the future.
